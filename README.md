<b>GIFMAP</b> <br>
Gif "Graphics Interchange Format"is an image file format and it supports both animated and static images. It is commonly used on many social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Tinder, Tumblr to send moving images. Today, there are many GIF websites that people use to create/search gifs. Current gif sites perform searches according to hashtags. If any of the search words matches with one of the hashtags, then the gif is retrieved and displayed to the user. Some of the gifs include subtitles, but the search engines of the gif sites do not perform searches according to subtitles but hashtags. Our proposed search engine will do searches taking into account the subtitles as well as hashtags.
GIFMAP is a gif search engine that gives its users a simpler and clearer results compared to other gif sites. Gif Map, with its various filters, saves time for its users, and also helps them find what they are looking for. Compared to other gif sites; Gif Map is simple, clear and convenient to use.
 
First of all, it is very simple to use GifMap. GifMap helps you find the line/subtitle you are looking for, or you can turn your daily conversations into fun gifs. You can find what you are looking for easily such as the name of the tv series, line, name of the player etc. by typing in the large search box that is placed in the middle of the site. Results of the GifMap do not show all the gifs in the database. If you do not like the resulting gifs, you can access new ones by using the shuffle button on the right side of the website.
 
The difference between Gif Map and other gif sites is that it will search and display the results faster. Instead of giving every single gif in the database as a result, a new result can be obtained by giving a single gif. After the search statement is entered, using improved filtering options a clearer result will be obtained and displayed to the user.
 
In Gif Map, you can download gifs and unify them with one touch. If the result you are looking for is “A better way.”, the site creates a collage of gifs between (1-3) that are visible to you. If you enter “A+better+way.”, you will only see one gif. You can download the collage prepared for you individually or by clicking the camera button on the right side of the collage to convert your collage of gifs into a video, and download it at once. You can also turn the sound on/off of the gif/collage. Once you are done, you can easily share your work from social media links that are placed on the site.
 
Throughout the semester, we will be focusing on how to improve our GifMap, and to receive the patent of it. We will be comparing our gif search engine with other sites to improve its features and making it easier to use. We will make sure that GifMap will be unique of its kind.

<b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b>

Today, there are many gif sites such as Tumblr, Giphy, Tenor, Gfycat etc. These websites perform searches according to hashtags. Compared to other gif sites, GifMap will be unique of its kind because it gives its users simpler, clearer, and faster results. Sometimes the gifs that the user enters include subtitles, but the search engines of the existing gif sites do not perform searches according to subtitles but hashtags. Our proposed search engine will do searches taking into account the subtitles as well as hashtags. In this section of the patent application proposal, we will compare our GifMap with other existing gif sites, and analyze its advantages and disadvantages.

ADVANTAGES
 
Simple and Convenient
GifMap’s site structure is simple to understand and easy to use. For example, understanding the site "Tumblr" is much harder and it does not meet the user experience. Tumblr is not only designed for gifs, but also many other features such as photos, texts, videos, quotes etc. So it is much harder for users to find the gifs that they are looking for.

Accessibility
For example, Imgur is not available in every country because it does not comply with their Internet protocols, but GifMap will be designed in a way that it will be available in most countries.
 
DISADVANTAGES
 
Filtering
It is difficult to find the gifs unless its filtering option is well designed. To give an example, user might want to search for line/subtitles. If the filtering is not well designed, which means if it is not used with correct hashtags, it will be harder to find the gifs that the user was looking for.
 
Details
GifMap does not display all the gifs that are in the database. If the user does not like the resulting gifs, he/she can access new ones by using the shuffle button on the right side of the website. Thus, there might be some problems if the searched gif is really detailed. For example, “Giphy”is slow compared to GifMap since it displays much more results than our gif search engine, but it offers more detailed results.
 
Size
Gifs with sounds take up more space, so that the collages that are created from multiple gifs could take up more space in the memory and this can be a disadvantage.
